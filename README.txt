TODO:

****currently halfway to implementing interactive mode as main mode.  To do so, the openEntry() and interactiveMode() needs to parse a date, not a file name.***

-Add optionality for importing new templates or synbcing up with other apps (ie. a running to do list)

This branches aim is to create a backing up system.
This will require:
-learning how to incorporate parameters into scripts
-reviewing the commands to compress files
-ideally, the user has some way of dictating where the compressed files should land...
