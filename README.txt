TODO:
-Refactor openEntry() to parse a date, not a file name.

-Add interactive mode by using "read" commands

-Add optionality for importing new templates (ie. a running to do list)


This branches aim is to create a backing up system.
This will require:
-learning how to incorporate parameters into scripts
-reviewing the commands to compress files
-ideally, the user has some way of dictating where the compressed files should land...
